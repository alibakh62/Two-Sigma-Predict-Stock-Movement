# Two-Sigma-Predict-Stock-Movement
This repository contains my solution to the following Kaggle competition: Two Sigma: Using News to Predict Stock Movements

**V1 Notes:**
- The `base` folder contains very simple script to get started.
- Some initial dataprep and feature engineering is done in the `DataPreparation` class.
- This was a kernel-only competition, so all the data read/write had be done through kernel's own starter module.
- There is a whole lot need to be done in terms of both feature engineering and the model.
